I’m **Aricka Lewis**, a designer currently working in Enterprise UX at RevUnit.

Two years out of college, I’m fortunate to have had the opportunity to explore advertising, marketing, user experience design, and design research. My focus at RevUnit is on workforce transformation.
Outside of work, I am a musician (shameless band plug here), volunteer, hobbyist photographer, and stumbling my way through adulthood.
Currently navigating the intersection of design, technology, and race.
