<strong>Alyissa Johnson</strong> was born and raised in the booming metropolis of Ottawa before scarpering off to the nearby University of Kansas to study graphic design. She graduated in 2011 with two degrees, a fair amount of debt, and dreams of success and notoriety.
 
Today Alyissa lives in Kansas City as a designer, a self-taught handlettering artist, and occasional teacher. She shacks up with her enthusiastic but remarkably timid guinea pig Peach, maintaining a kitchen full of gadgets she rarely uses. On the weekends you may find her at a local craft fair, selling prints and tapestries of her work with a wry smile. She’s not quite notorious yet, but she’s working on it.
