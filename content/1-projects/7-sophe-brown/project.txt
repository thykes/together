I love bad puns and good tv shows, and sometimes I converse solely in Simpsons quotes. I'm also obsessed with design. My real love is typography, but I dabble in all visual languages, be they moving pictures, handcrafted designs, photography or illustration.

I've been practicing this design caper since I was a youngin'. In primary school, I made greeting cards for pocket money. In high school, I traded the paper craft in and took up jewelry making. These days I go by Sophie Elinor, and I try to use design for good; to positively help people. I'm very hire-able, and if you have a job that needs doing, I'd love to meet you.
