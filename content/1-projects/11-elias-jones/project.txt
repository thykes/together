Beginning with my formative years in the great Pacific North West, I've always had a curiosity for how things might be improved and a desire to be hands-on in affecting positive change. I've been fortunate to leverage these and other attributes into a 20+ year design career leading to many adventures in a wide variety of settings, from a renegade ad agency in Italy (way before Facebook was a thing) to in-house creative services at large & mid-size companies. I'm incredibly grateful to make a living at the intersection of form and function, and I enter every business challenge with a designer's mindset of "what if ?"

At home, I'm "Popa" to my grandson, an immensely rewarding role that informs my design work through continuous lessons in empathy.
