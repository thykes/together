I've got a couple art history degrees, back from when I knew I wanted to make things, but didn't know what I wanted to make. Turns out I wanted to make all kinds of stuff but didn't know I could choose "Everything".

In the years since I've worked on a lot of TV shows & network packages. I've designed feature film main titles & graphics. I've made cartoons, drawn live-action storyboards, designed logos, self-published a couple books of robot drawings and a few other things. 

Somehow I also find time to ride bikes and make damn good coffee.
