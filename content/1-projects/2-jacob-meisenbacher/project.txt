I am **Jacob Meisenbacher**, a recent graduate of the University of Arkansasâ€™ design program.

During my time studying design, I have had the opportunity to intern with Tesseract Game Center at the University of Arkansas (Video game design/UX&UI/graphic design/ web design/motion graphics), Crystal Bridges (Application Design/tech support), Creative promo (Marketing design), and Collective Bias (UX, UI). 

Outside of design, I enjoy playing guitar, cooking, and working in my wood/metal shop. I also enjoy photography as a side hobby, both darkroom and digital.
